It is fairly typical that your actual modeling process will not match the narrative you describe at the end, since the final version will be cleaned up and won't include extraneous details about things you tried that didn't work. For example, unless you had a specific reason to tell stakeholders why `origin` wasn't part of the final model, your final narrative can just skip over talking about `origin` at all, as this one does.\n",

    "In this lesson you looked at several different multiple regression models, all built using one-hot encoded categorical features in addition to numeric features. You saw how the choice of a reference category impacts the interpretation of the coefficients, and also walked through several different examples of what to do and what not to do when you encounter a feature with many categories."
